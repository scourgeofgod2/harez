      "Creating a responsive layout with CSS Grid is straightforward. Here's a basic example:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));\n  gap: 1rem;\n}\n```\n\nThis creates a grid where:\n- Columns automatically fit as many as possible\n- Each column is at least 250px wide\n- Columns expand to fill available space\n- There's a 1rem gap between items\n\nWould you like me to explain more about how this works?",

      "Sure! CSS Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system designed for the browser. Unlike Flexbox which is primarily designed for either a row or a column, Grid can work with both rows and columns together.\n\nHere are some key features of CSS Grid:\n\n1. **Two-dimensional layout**: Control both rows and columns simultaneously\n2. **Grid lines**: Position items by referencing grid lines\n3. **Grid tracks**: Rows and columns can be explicitly sized or can adjust automatically\n4. **Grid cells**: Intersections of rows and columns\n5. **Grid areas**: Named regions spanning multiple grid cells\n\nBasic syntax example:\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;\n  grid-template-rows: auto 200px auto;\n  gap: 20px;\n}\n\n.item {\n  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Start at line 1, end at line 3 */\n  grid-row: 2 / 3; /* Start at line 2, end at line 3 */\n}\n```\n\nThis creates a layout with three columns (the middle one being twice as wide) and three rows (middle one fixed at 200px), with 20px gaps between all cells.",

    content:
      "**Flexbox vs. Grid: When to Use Each**\n\n**Flexbox (one-dimensional):**\n- Best for arranging items in a single row or column\n- Great for distributing space among items within a container\n- Perfect for:\n  - Navigation menus\n  - Card layouts with variable content length\n  - Centering items vertically and horizontally\n  - Simple layouts that need to be flexible in one direction\n\n**Grid (two-dimensional):**\n- Best for complex layouts with both rows and columns\n- Excellent for precisely positioning items in a grid system\n- Perfect for:\n  - Full-page layouts\n  - Dashboard interfaces\n  - Image galleries with consistent spacing\n  - Any design that requires alignment across both rows and columns\n\n**When to use both:**\nIt's common to use Grid for the main page layout and Flexbox for individual components within that layout. They complement each other well!",
